If you feel like contributing, don't be afraid, docs, issues, code, code reviews, anything is useful.

As of Dec 7 2020 there isn't a lot of setup required 

- fork
- clone
- branch out your change
- make a pull request

If your change is enough to make a release on its own the pull request will be tagged as `release` and once it gets merged a new nuget package will be released shortly, if there is more code/features in the pipeline it will be released on the next opportunity with the rest of the code.

In general, we use this [project](https://github.com/glennawatson/ChangeLog#commit-prefixes) to generate the change logs so if you can follow those rules for your commits that will help in a great way
